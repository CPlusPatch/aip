    <b>A truly open AI!</b>

The AIP is the very creative current working name of [Jesse Wierzbinski](https://cpluspatch.com/)'s and [Erik Uden](https://erikuden.com/)'s project with the goal of creating a free and open source artificial intelligence chatbot, scientific tool, research bot, or generally a language interpreter alternative to the locked down and proprietary solutions that already exist. 

Using a modern UI design and state-of-the-art newly published open source AI language models (*[LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) - 65 billion parameters*), the AIP is a product of its time. 


### The way we currently want to design the platform:
1. Every user is free to sign up via OpenID, Mastodon / Fediverse, or E-Mail and then receives a free amount of credits to use on the AI, each credit represents one character generated.
2. There is a STRIPE integration and a functioning invoicing system through which users can buy more credits.
3. Alternatively to buying more credits a user can pay 10â‚¬/month to generate infinite characters and use the AI and API to the AI for as much as they choose.

### What will happen to the money users paid?

All revenue will go towards continuing the project and expanding the AI's capacities and capabilities, as well as funding [mastodon.de](https://mastodon.de/), a free and open source decentralized social network. Of course the money should also be used to reimburse and continuously pay its main developers, currently just Jesse Wierzbinski,  as she worked tirelessly from morning to night on this project for months without even expecting money. If we ever reach the point of profitability, as **we plan on operating this service at a loss for a really long time**, of course the people maintaining it shall be reimbursed and compensated fairly, as this project does eat a lot of resource both time and money-wise, yet **we are doing it anyway out of love and interest in the technology!**
